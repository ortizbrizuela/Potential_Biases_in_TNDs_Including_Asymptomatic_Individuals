## Study Summary

The study investigates potential biases that can occur in test-negative design (TND) studies for evaluating COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness, particularly when asymptomatic individuals are included in the analysis. The simulations conducted aim to quantify these biases and offer insights on their implications for vaccine effectiveness estimation.
